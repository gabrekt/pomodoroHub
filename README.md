# Pomodoro Hub

Pomodoro Hub is a simpleweb application designed to enhance productivity and because i wanted my own timer. It combines a Pomodoro timer, a task manager, and a notes section into one ugly interface, making it harder for users to focus on their work, manage tasks, and jot down quick notes all in one place.

Right now it has limited functionallity, but we're (me and my cat) currently working in new versions.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Utilize the Pomodoro technique with a 25-minute focus timer followed by short breaks to maximize productivity.
- **Task Manager**: Keep track of your tasks with an easy-to-use interface that allows you to add and mark tasks as complete.
- **Notes Section**: Quickly jot down your thoughts or important information in the notes section.
